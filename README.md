# Road Sign Image Understanding Project

## Project Overview
This project is a deep learning-based system designed to classify road sign images into categories such as **traffic light**, **stop sign**, **speed limit**, and **crosswalk**. Using a convolutional neural network (CNN), the model processes a dataset of labeled images and predicts the type of road sign.

## Dataset Structure
Ensure that the dataset is organized as follows:

- **Images**: Road sign images are stored in the `images/` folder.
- **Annotations**: Corresponding XML files with bounding boxes and labels are in the `annotations/` folder.

### Folder Structure
/road_sign/
├── images/
├── image1.jpg
├── image2.png
└── ... 
├── annotations/ │
├── annotation1.xml │
├── annotation2.xml │
└── ...

3. **Trained Model**:
   - The trained model is saved in the `outputs/models` folder as `model.h5`.

### Example Results
Here is a preview of the outputs generated by the program:
- **Training Accuracy**: ~90% after 10 epochs.
- **Validation Accuracy**: ~88% after 10 epochs.
- **Test Accuracy**: ~87% on unseen data.

Example prediction:
- **True Label**: `Stop Sign`
- **Predicted Label**: `Stop Sign`
- **Confidence**: `96%`

## Steps in the Workflow
1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Parse XML files to extract image labels.
   - Preprocess images (resize to 128x128 and normalize pixel values).
   - Map labels to indices.

2. **Model Training**:
   - Train a CNN with convolutional and fully connected layers.
   - Use dropout layers to prevent overfitting.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate performance on a test dataset (20% split).

4. **Visualization**:
   - Display graphs of training/validation performance.
   - Visualize predictions on test images.
